# python-project-template

[kr-ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥](README.md) | **[en-English]**

A standardized Python project template with minimal configuration, integrating essential tools like `black`, `isort`, `mypy`, and `pylint` with `tox` for code formatting, linting, and type checking. This template simplifies the development workflow by including all necessary settings.

---

## Purpose

This template aims to reduce the hassle of setting up a new Python project every time and helps maintain consistent code style and quality by providing:

- Code formatter: **black**
- Import organizer: **isort**
- Type checker: **mypy**
- Code linter: **pylint**
- Integrated test and lint automation tool: **tox**

With `tox`, you can easily run the above tools and test across multiple Python versions with the default environment setup.

---

## Main Configuration Files

- `tox.ini`  
  Defines environments for running various lint, format, and type check tools individually or all at once.  
  Designed to allow running all check tools with a single `tox` command or selecting specific tools as needed.

- `pyproject.toml`  
  Centralizes configuration for major tools like `black`, `isort`, `mypy`, and `pylint`.  
  Maintains consistent style and rules, and supports convenient tool configuration.

## How to Use

### 1. Create a Template Repository

- Use [python-project-template](https://github.com/yourusername/python-project-template) repository as a template on GitHub  
- Click the "Use this template" button to create a new project and clone it

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

After creating and activating a Python virtual environment in the project root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows PowerShell

pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install tox
```

---

### 3. Run Check Tools

- **Run all check tools (black, isort, mypy, pylint):**

  ```bash
  tox
  ```

- **Run individual tools (examples):**

  ```bash
  tox -e black    # Code formatting (black)
  tox -e isort    # Import sorting (isort)
  tox -e mypy     # Type checking (mypy)
  tox -e pylint   # Code linting (pylint)
  tox -e lint     # Shortcut for running only pylint
  ```

### 4. Customize Settings

- Modify options for each tool in the `[tool.black]`, `[tool.isort]`, `[tool.mypy]`, `[tool.pylint]` sections of `pyproject.toml`.
- If needed, adjust target paths or environment variables in `tox.ini`.

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. After coding, run `tox -e black` and `tox -e isort` to format code style and organize imports
2. Run `tox -e mypy` to check for type errors
3. Run `tox -e pylint` to check code quality and potential issues
4. Finally, run the `tox` command to perform all checks at once
